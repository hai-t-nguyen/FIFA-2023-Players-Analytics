## Objective

The FIFA 2023 Players Analytics project aims to provide comprehensive insights into the performance, characteristics, and values of football teams and players. The analysis includes team and player attributes, machine learning predictions, and valuable implications for various stakeholders in the football industry.

## Methodology

### Data Collection:
Utilized the "teams_fifa23.csv" and â€œplayers_fifa23.csv" datasets for analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted thorough EDA to uncover data patterns, trends, and outliers. Explored key performance metrics, characteristics, and values of teams and players.

### Machine Learning Models:
Applied machine learning models for predictions based on collected data. Leveraged algorithms to analyze and forecast various football player performance aspects.

### Data Integration:
Integrated insights from EDA and machine learning models to present a holistic view of the football landscape.
